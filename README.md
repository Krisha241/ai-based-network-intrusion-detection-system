# 🔐 AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to monitor network traffic, detect malicious activities, and generate alerts. The system integrates machine learning with real-time packet capture, logging, and visualization to simulate SOC-level intrusion detection scenarios.
